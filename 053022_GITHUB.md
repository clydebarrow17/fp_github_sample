# Definitions
Git = 
- free and open source version control system
	- version control = management of changes of documents, computers, programs, and etc

Directory = Folder, Location (C:\\Clyde)

Terminal / Command Line = Interface for text commands, 

CLI = Command Line Interface

Code Editor = Word Processor for Writing Code, IDE (?)

Repository = Project, or folder/place where your project is kept (is this original or pulled?), aka "repo"

Github = Website to host repositories online

# Syntax
Some commands in the CLI = 
- `cd` = Change Directory
- `init` = Sets up a directory with to be used with git commands
- `clone` = Bring a repository that is hosted somewhere (like in Github) into a folder on your local machine
- `add` = Track your files and changes in Git
- `commit` = Save your files in Git
- `push` = Upload git commits to the remote repository
- `pull` = Download changes from remote repo to your local machine, opposite of push
	- `fetch` = Gets any changes from the remote repo to your local repo. is usually used before a `pull`
- `restore` = Removes the change in the untracked file
	- can have an additional parameter (--staged) ro remove the file from tracked to untracked
- `revert` = Removes the `commit` using the hash of the commit seen in `log`
	- `log` = Shows the hash, message, time, and etc of the commit
- `--explain` = A parameter that can usually be used with other git syntax, is similar with python's `help(method/syntax)`
- Commands relation to status = 
	- `add` = (Untracked -> Added) OR (Modified -> Modified(in staging))
	- `commit` = All files in staging (tracked) -> Local Repo (Unmodified, ready for `push`)
	- `push` = Local Repo -> Remote Repo

\
Git Status (File States) = 
- Untracked = File is new and Git has no knowledge of this file
- Added (only in VSC) = File is new and can be tracked. Status is usually seen when an Untracked file is put into staging
- Unmodified = File is a 1:1 copy from the local repo
- Modified = File has changes, recognized by Git and will be included in the next `commit`
- Staged = File is ready to be pushed to the repo 



# Procedure
```md

First time, using VSC GUI
- [ ] Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) -> git clone
- [ ] Type repo URL (HTML or SSH)
- [ ] Choose local repo location
- [ ] Add to workspace
- [ ] Source Control -> Initialize Repo

*Add -> Commit -> Push (own repo)
- [ ] *edit the file
- [ ] Source Control -> Stage Changes
- [ ] Source Control -> Commit (Type in a message [required], then ctrl + enter)
- [ ] Sync

*Add -> Commit -> Push (other repo, advised even in solo)
- [ ] In GitHub, fork the repo
- [ ] Command Palette -> git clone
- [ ] Type forked repo URL (HTML or SSH)
- [ ] Command Palette -> Create Branch
- [ ] Choose forked repo
- [ ] Type branch name
- [ ] Command Palette -> Checkout to forked repo -> Name of created branch
- [ ] *edit the file
- [ ] Source Control -> Stage Changes
- [ ] Source Control -> Commit (Type in a message [required], then ctrl + enter)
- [ ] Source Control -> Publish (or sync if branch is published)
- [ ] Source Control -> Branch -> Create Pull Request (PR)
- [ ] Type in title and description (advised)
- [ ] Create
- [ ] (For the owner of the repo) Review PR

*Checkout -> Merge (updating localrepo/branch with selected localrepo/main)
- [ ] Command Palette -> Checkout to -> Select Repo -> Select Branch
- [ ] Command Palette -> Merge -> Select Repo -> Select main
*You can auto fetch via Settings -> auto fetch -> true

*Checkout -> Merge -> Pull (updating localrepo/main with selected localrepo/branch AND remote repo/main)
- [ ] Command Palette -> Checkout to -> Select Repo -> Select main
- [ ] Command Palette -> Merge -> Select Repo -> Select branch
- [ ] Source Control -> Sync

*Fetch -> Pull (updating localrepo/main, when remote repo (main, or any branch realy) has updates)
- [ ] Command Palette -> Fetch -> Select Repo -> Select main
- [ ] Command Palette -> Pull -> Select Repo
- [ ] Command Palette -> Checkout to -> Select Repo -> Select main

**File Status and Location 

*Modified (Staged) -> Unmodified (unstaged)
- [ ] Source Control -> More Actions -> Commit -> Undo Last Commit
	*Reverts the `commit` (Staged -> Staging)
- [ ] Source Control -> Staged Changes -> Unstage Changes
	*Reverts the `add` (Staging -> Unstaged)
- [ ] Source Control -> Changes -> Discard Changes
	*Revers any changes on file (Modified -> Unmodified, Added -> Untracked)	

```

\*Personally, I think it is best to create a branch before editing the repo, whether it is your own repo or forked repo. This allows the owner to check for the changes from the branch/repo. Should it be declined, your copy, the branch/repo, should not be affected and can still be used with your changes.

#### What I think this guide is missing:

- [ ] GitHub Setup (I am assuming you already have one)
	- [ ] Account Registration
	- [ ] Repo Creation
- [ ] Icons in each step in Procedure - VSC (Discord doesn't support image embeds. Avoiding any security issues on file transfer (sending the .md file))
- [ ] Sample output for each command/procedure (See above, also too time-consuming)
- [ ] SSH Setup (Guide is long overdue. Will update with this ASAP)
- [ ] Git history graph (I do not know any VSC extensions that show a visual history graph at the moment...)
- [ ] Proper example of when to use `merge` vs `rebase` (Refer to checkbox above)
- [ ] Procedure Checking using Vim (Skill issue by the guide author lmao)


Date start = 05/30/22
Date end = 06/04/22
== END ==

#### Random/old notes below:

ctrl + \` = terminal in vsc
// did not ask me after push, unlike dun sa lesson?

// study ssh?

//git merge
// undo stages etc


//opposite of the git process
//visual diagrams
//git revert -head

**HOW TO GET REPO FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL MACHINE (first time)**

- [ ] Get link of repo in Clone/Download
- [ ] Clone via
	- [ ] ctrl shift p -> git clone -> repo link -> select directory for repo in local machine -> 
		- [ ] VSC Source Control -> initialize repo -> select repo directory in local machine with .git folder, OR
	- [ ] in terminal, locate chosen directory -> `git clone "link"` -> in terminal, locate repo folder
- [ ] 

- [ ] (For Untracked Status):
	- [ ] Source Control -> Highlight all files you want to be tracked -> VSC Command Palette -> Stage Selected Status, OR
	- [ ] `git add .` ( `.` refers to all of the untracked files to be staged/added)

\* .git folder stores all of the commits 

- [ ] (For Staging files. Refer to this checkbox if you want to put your changes from the local repo to the github repo)
	- [ ]  Source Control -> Source Control (dropdown tab) -> Type any message -> ctrl enter, OR
	- [ ] `git commit -m "message"` ( `-m` refers to mesage, 1st for the mesage, 2nd for the description box) 	recorded in the folder/repo

\* This only "prepares" files with changes to Git, for Git to put the files in the repo on the github, refer to:

- [ ] (For Staged files)
	- [ ] Sync Changes, OR
	- [ ] `git push origin master` (`origin` refers to the location of the repo in the local machine; uses the directory selected in the terminal)


/* If its a repo that you dont own, refer to these steps:
- [ ] In GitHub, Fork original repo (aka branch)
- [ ] Clone -> Stage -> Commit -> Push
- [ ] In GitHub, create PR (pull request) on the original repo

*random notes below (from procedure)

pull from main to update main
rbanch is usable for only 1, advised to create another branch from main after merge branch
pull updates local repo
fetch does not
merge commit vs squash vs rebase

branch/forked repo -> create pr = creates a pull from the branch/forked repo to the original repo
checkout changes the current branch

fetch, pull

create branch -> publish to origin 
origin -> forked repo
upstream -> original repo
